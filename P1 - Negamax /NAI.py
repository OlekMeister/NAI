"""
    "Dodge The Pile" is a two-player turn-based game where players take alternating turns manipulating a shared score.
    The objective of the game is to strategically add or subtract numbers from the score in a way that avoids negative values.
    The available numbers for moves are shared between the players and consist of the following integers: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12].

    Player 1 and Player 2, represented by AI and Human players, respectively, compete to achieve different win conditions.
    Player 1 (AI) aims to secure victory by ensuring that the final score is less than zero
    while Player 2 (Human) seeks to win by achieving a final score greater than zero.

    The game provides a variety of possible moves at each turn, and each number may be used only once throughout the game.
    The players take turns making their moves and strategically depleting the pool of available numbers.
    The game ends when one of the players achieves their respective win condition or when there are no more moves available.
