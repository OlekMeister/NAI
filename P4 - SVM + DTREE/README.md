# Decision tree and Support Vector Machines

This program showcases the implementation of Decision Trees (DT) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) in Python. The Decision Tree algorithm is utilized for analyzing datasets and making decisions based on various input features, forming a tree-like structure. Support Vector Machines, on the other hand, use mathematical models to classify data points into different categories.

In this project, the focus is on applying these machine learning algorithms to two distinct datasets: the Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset and the Milk Quality Prediction dataset. The program evaluates the performance of Decision Trees and Support Vector Machines on these datasets, providing insights into their classification capabilities.
