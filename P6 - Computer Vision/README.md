# Smile Detection Program

**Author:** Aleksander Guzik

## Description:

This program utilizes Haar cascades to perform real-time smile detection through the webcam. The script detects faces and then identifies smiles within those detected faces. To exit the program, press the 'Esc' key.

## Requirements:

- [opencv-python](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/): Install using the command `pip install opencv-python`.

## Usage:

1. Ensure that the required library, opencv-python, is installed.
2. Run the script.
3. The program will open a window displaying the webcam feed with smile detection.
4. Press the 'Esc' key to exit the program.

## Additional Information:

The smile detection is based on two Haar cascades: one for face detection and the other for smile detection. Adjustments to the detection parameters can be made within the script to optimize performance based on specific use cases.
